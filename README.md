## Technologies
Python, Matplotlib, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, Flask


## Data Source
Data found in resources/hawaii-measurements.csv and resources/hawaii-stations.csv.


## Installation
Code was tested using Python 3.8.  The environment also needs pandas and matplotlib. The environment was setup as follows:

conda create -n envpy38 python=3.8 anaconda
source activate envpy38
jupyter notebook


If environment does not include pandas or matplotlib then install the following from terminal:

conda install pandas
conda install matplotlib
